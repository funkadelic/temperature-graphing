temperature-graphing
====================
A project to graph temperature data from the [ControlByWeb temperature module](http://www.controlbyweb.com/temperature/) and the Nest Thermostat into rrdtool. Nest Thermostat data retrieved via [nest-api](https://github.com/gboudreau/nest-api). Optionally send your temperature reading to the [Weather Undergrond Personal Weather Station service](http://www.wunderground.com/weatherstation/about.asp) as well.
